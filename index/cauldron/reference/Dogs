[Intro]  Dm7(9)  D#7M(9)  A4(7)  Bb7/Ab

     Dm7(9)
You got to be crazy, you gotta have a real need
        D#7M(9)
Gotta sleep on your toes and when you're on the street
                                                       A4(7)
You got to be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed

Then moving in silently downwind and out of sight
 Bb7/Ab
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking
    Dm7(9)
And after a while you can work on points of style
           D#7M(9)
Like the club tie and the firm handshake

A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
     A4(7)
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
          Bb7/Ab
So that when they turn their backs on you

You'll get the chance to put the knife in

        Dm7(9)
You've gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
               D#7M(9)
You know it's gonna get harder, harder and harder as you get older
    A4(7)                                                                    Bb7/Ab
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south, hide your head in the sand
                                                     Dm7(9)
Just another sad old man, all alone and dying of cancer

 Dm7(9)
Gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
 D#7M(9)
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
 A4(7)
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
      Bb7/Ab
If I don't stand my own ground how can I find my way out of this maze
 Dm7(9)
Deaf, dumb and blind you just keep on pretending
     D#7M(9)
That everyone's expendable and no one has a real friend
        A4(7)
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
    Bb7/Ab
And everything's done under the sun

And you believe at heart everyone's a killer
