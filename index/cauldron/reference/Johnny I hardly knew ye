While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo 
While goin' the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo 
While goin' the road to sweet Athy 
A stick in me hand and a drop in me eye 
A doleful damsel I heard cry, Johnny I hardly knew ye. 

With your drums and guns and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo 
With your drums and guns and drums and guns, hurroo, hurroo 
With your drums and guns and drums and guns 
The enemy nearly slew ye 
Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer Johnny I hardly knew ye. 

Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo 
Where are your eyes that were so mild, hurroo, hurroo 
Where are your eyes that were so mild When my heart you so beguiled 
Why did ye run from me and the child 
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye. 

Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo 
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo 
Where are your legs that used to run 
When you went for to carry a gun 
Indeed your dancing days are done 
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ye. 

I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo 
I'm happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo 
I'm happy for to see ye home 
All from the island of Sulloon 
So low in flesh, so high in bone 
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye. 

Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo 
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg, hurroo, hurroo 
Ye haven't an arm, ye haven't a leg 
Ye're an armless, boneless, chickenless egg 
Ye'll have to put with a bowl out to beg 
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ye. 

They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo 
They're rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo 
They're rolling out the guns again 
But they never will take our sons again 
No they never will take our sons again 
Johnny I'm swearing to ye.
